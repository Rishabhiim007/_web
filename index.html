                        It's been a month since I joined Cosyugma info llp, I joined here as a product management intern. My tasks revolved around defining the roadmap from product development to launch, defining customer journey, understand in depth about the product, defining stakeholders, designing wireframes and documentation for the product. IT was overall a nice experince and Rishabh and team was supportive and full with knowledge and zeal for the development of the product.
                        Apart from the technical skills I gained, I learnt to become and manage my team as a leader. I gathered the required information, communicated the same to the development team, added my own insights about a possible solution. It gave me a chance to enhance my management skills as a Product Manager</div>

With all the little resources and little capital they have, they spend high on research and create a solution to the existing problem to gain traction.
                        I am thrilled to be a part of your firm. I have started learning new things about the industry and how to collect data for the industry and make a data-based decision to come to a conclusion, which helps to decide on which problem we should spend more on to have maximum utility.</div>
